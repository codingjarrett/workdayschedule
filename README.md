# workdayschedule
This is the repo for Coding Bootcamp Challenge #3 (Work Day Scheduler).

## Description
This project entailed combining written HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a save-able work schedule, which is seperated into hour segments, follows real-time with color coordination and re-displays when the page is reloaded.

## Usage:
As a coding boot camp student, I want to create a schedule. When I open the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When I scroll down, then I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. When I view the timeblocks for that day, then each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. When I click into a timeblock, then I can enter an event. When I click the save button for that timeblock, then the text for that event is saved in local storage. When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist.
